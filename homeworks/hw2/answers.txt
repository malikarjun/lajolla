Q1. Single monochromatic absorption-only homogeneous volume
Ans. Upon changing the absorption coefficient to 0, the emissive sphere is very bright indicating that the medium is
not attenuating light as it travels.

Q2. Single monochromatic homogeneous volume with absorption and single-scattering, no surface lighting
Ans. Upon increasing the sigma_s, the overall image gets dimmer due to increased out-scattering. Upon decreasing the
sigma_s the image gets brighter disproportionately for the sphere compared to its surrounding. This is due to reduced
out-scattering for the light being emitted from the sphere.

Upon increasing the sigma_a, the image gets darker overall, more so around the sphere. This happens due to the increased
absorption of radiance. Upon decreasing the sigma_a, the image gets brighter especially around the sphere due to reduced
absorption of radiance.
